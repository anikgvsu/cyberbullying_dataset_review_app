When Eleanor's approach was selected by the board, Vincent began sending her messages that maintained a collegial tone while subtly undermining her, writing things like \"Congratulations on pushing your solution through‚Äîit's impressive how you manage to simplify complex problems, even when that means overlooking crucial details.\" Each message appeared supportive to outside observers while delivering precisely targeted criticisms that Vincent knew would trigger Eleanor's professional insecurities.",
